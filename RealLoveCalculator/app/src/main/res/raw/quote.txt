I fell in love with you because you loved me when i couldn’t love myself.
I don’t want anything from life except you are next to me.
I feel great lucky everyday when i’m with you.
Don’t say you love me unless you really mean it, because I might do something crazy like believe it.
Whatever the world moves us away your name will remain chiseled in my heart.
A relationship where you can sit around doing nothing, but still have fun cause you’re together is priceless.
